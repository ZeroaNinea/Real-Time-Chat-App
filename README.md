# Real-Time Chat Application

This is my first pet project. I want to implement these staps here.

1. **Connect to Socket.io** âœ… 
- Basic Socket.io connection.
- Sending and displaying messages.

2. **User Accounts & Authentication**  
   - Implement JWT authentication (yes, it's a good choice for a chat app).
   - Set up registration and login with password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
   - Allow users to store display names and profile pictures.

3. **Chat Rooms & Message Storage**  
   - Design a database schema for users, messages, and chat rooms.
   - Implement multiple chat rooms where users can join/leave.

4. **Frontend Enhancements**  
   - Use Angular Material and customize it to improve UI/UX.
   - Add a chat list UI, message bubbles, timestamps, etc.

5. **Real-Time Features**  
   - Show online/offline status for users.
   - Implement typing indicators ("User is typing...").
   - Add notifications for new messages.

6. **Testing & CI/CD Deployment**  
   - Write unit and integration tests.
   - Use Docker for your database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) and deploy it using Kubernetes if needed.
   - Set up CI/CD to deploy updates and allow friends to test your app.

7. **Final Enhancements**  
   - Improve performance with Redis caching.
   - Implement end-to-end encryption if necessary.
   - Optimize and polish the UI.
